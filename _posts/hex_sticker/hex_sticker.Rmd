In this post,
I want to describe how I created a hex sticker for one of my shiny apps.
The app itself lets users interactively explore their Strava data.

Because I called the app `SummitR`, I decided to display one of the most famous
summit finishes in cycling history: Alpe d'Huez.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("hex_sticker.R")
```

I am using the following packages:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

The `hexSticker` package is used to create the final sticker.

Because I already climbed Alpe d'Huez on a previous occasion, I can get the data
already prepared from a private github repository. The data in the corresponding
repository is organised as a [pin](https://github.com/rstudio/pins):

```{r alpe_dhuez_act}
```

In raw table form the data of the activity looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_act 
```

Create a minimalistic plot of the activity. Only take variables `lat` and `lng`
into account:

```{r gg_act}
```

Plot the path of the activity on a black background:

```{r, minimal_path_dark}
gg_act +
  theme_dark()
```

Save the finished hex sticker as result. Use the official Strava color as
background color.

```{r save_result}
```

```{r, preview=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("hex_sticker_wide.png")
```
